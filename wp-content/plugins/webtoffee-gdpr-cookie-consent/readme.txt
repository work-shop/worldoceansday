A simple way to show how your website complies with the EU Cookie Law / GDPR. Style it to match your own website.

== Description ==

NOTE: INSTALLING THIS PLUGIN ALONE DOESNT MAKE YOUR SITE GDPR COMPLIANT. SINCE EACH SITE USES DIFFERENT COOKIES, YOU MAY NEED TO BUILD OPT IN/OUT CAPABILITY TO HANDLE YOUR SITE SPECIFIC NEEDS.

Our plugin will help you to become GDPR compliant with following features. 

- Plugin will show a notice with Accept and Reject options. By default the cookie value will be set to 'null'. If the user clicks 'Accept' button the value with be changed to 'yes'. IF the user clicks on 'Reject' the value will be set to 'no'. Your developer can check this value to set a cookie

- Admin can add cookie details from the backend. The list of cookies can be displayed in your cookie policy page by using a short code


This plugin adds a subtle banner to your website either in the header or footer so you can show your compliance status regarding the new EU Cookie Law.


You can fully customise the style so it fits in with your existing website- change the colours, fonts, styles, the position on the page and even how it behaves when you click "accept".


You can choose to make the cookie bar disappear after a few seconds (completely configurable) or to accept on scroll (an option available under Italian law).


It also has a Cookie Audit module so you can easily show what cookies your site uses and display them neatly in a table on your Privacy & Cookies Policy page.


This plugin supports WPML and qTranslate so your translation needs are covered.


Inline with official ICO guidelines and current industry best practice, this plugin uses 'implied consent' to aid you in showing your compliance status. This is a deliberate design choice that does not proactively block cookies: it doesn't make your visitors take action before they can use your website, and will not interfere with blog comments and [Google] Analytics. This approach is aimed at reducing website visitor dropout and maintaining your vital analytics data.

For a demo, [check out the EU Cookie Law website](http://cookielawinfo.com/ "Demo the EU Cookie Law plugin"), including the table of cookies on the Privacy Policy page.


Features:

* Fully customisable to look just like your own website's style: customise the colours, styles and fonts
* Put the cookie bar in either the header or the footer
* (Optional) accept cookie policy if the user scrolls
* (Optional) automatically close the cookie bar after a delay (delay is configurable)
* (Optional) cookie bar can be permanently dismissed or accessible through a "show again" tab
* (Optional) "show again" tab is fully customisable including position shown on page and styles
* "Cookie Audit" shortcode to construct a nicely-styled 'Privacy & Cookie Policy'
* WPML compatible
* qTranslate support

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

There's a lot of help available on the main plugin website. See:

http://cookielawinfo.com/faq
http://cookielawinfo.com/user-guide
http://cookielawinfo.com/support

= The cookie header isn't displaying =
First check you have installed the plugin and have activated it in the plugins panel.
To check if it is switched on or not, go to 'Settings / Cookie Law Info' and then enable the header by setting 'Display cookie bar?' to 'yes'.

= The header doesn't work on my browser =
Please report a bug on the support forum. Be sure to include the following information:

* Your URL (I will need this in order to help you!)
* WordPress version e.g. 4.2.2 (found in bottom right hand corner of dashboard)
* Browser e.g. FireFox, Chrome, IE
* Describe the problem

The more information you give, the quicker I can respond.

= What does this plugin do? =
This plugin will:

1. Add a banner to the top/bottom of all pages on your website, notifying the visitor that you have a clearly defined privacy and cookie policy.
2. Allow you to record which cookies your site uses, and:
3. Neatly display a list of these cookies (via a shortcode). You can put this list on your Privacy & Cookie Policy page, for example.

= Does this plugin block all cookies? =
No, and neither does any other WordPress plugin - be aware that despite what you may believe, it is not currently technically possible to completely block all cookies on your WordPress website without first updating all plugins that use cookies in some way. That is beyond the scope of any single plugin.
A more realistic approach for WordPress website owners is to use what is called "implied consent". This should not be a message buried on your website rather something more prominent that is clear to your visitors. This plugin can be used to highlight your compliance status and use of cookies in this way.


= Do visitors now have to accept/refuse cookies in order to use websites? =
In short, no, although there is a great deal of ambiguity around this law. What the law really gets at is privacy, not just cookies. The UK government, Google and many other major websites use "implied consent" on their own websites, which is the same technique used by this plugin. Further reading: http://cookielawinfo.com/cookie-law-101/

= Does this plugin stop cookies from being stored? =
No. Quite intentionally, this plugin will not do that. We have no way of knowing what plugins you use or how they work, so blocking/deleting cookies on a WordPress website/blog would possibly/probably break your site. Larger websites with huge budgets may well invest in such technology, but this plugin aims to help you provide a certain level of compliance without taking drastic action. If you do want blocking/deleting cookie functionality then (for now *) this is not the right plugin for you.

(*) Depending upon demand, this feature might be included in a future release.

= Does this plugin guarantee that I comply with this law? =
No.
As a generic plugin there's no way we can know anything about your specific circumstances. It can be used as part of an overall plan of action to comply, but just installing it and doing nothing more does nothing to help you. In all cases, you need to assess your own website's use of cookies and decide an appropriate course of action. If you are looking for specialist legal advice relating to your website you should always consult a lawyer.
